Folks, this is killer. For what this cobbler lacks in beauty it makes up ten-fold in taste, especially after a full day on the move. Not much mise en place when it comes to camp cooking, and I wouldnâ€™t want it any other way. Any summer fruit combination will do. I had strawberries and rhubarb on hand for this trip. I imagine peaches, plums, cherries, or blackberries will be fantastic as they come into season this summer.

At home: Mix together the dry ingredients, except sugar, and place in a bag or tupperware. Pack sugar separately. Measure out the buttermilk and transfer to a small container.

<ul>
    <li>2 lbs strawberries, hulled and halved</li>
    <li>2 stalks rhubarb, sliced</li>
    <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
    <li>3 cups flour (I used pastry)</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into small pieces</li>
    <li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
</ul>
