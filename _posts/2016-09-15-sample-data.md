These are just a few of the *available* **configuration** options. Many <code>configuration</code> options can <strike>either</strike> be specified as flags on the <abbr title="Command Line Tool">command line</abbr>, or alternatively (and more commonly) they can be specified in a _config.yml file at the root of the source directory. Jekyll will <a href="http://joro.me/" target="_blank">automatically use</a> the options from this file when run. For example, if you place the following lines in your _config.yml file.

This site aims to be a comprehensive guide to Jekyll. We’ll cover topics such as getting your site up and running, creating and managing your content, customizing the way your site works and looks, deploying to various environments, and give you some advice on participating in the future development of Jekyll itself.

Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through a converter (like Markdown) and our Liquid renderer, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server. Jekyll also happens to be the engine behind GitHub Pages, which means you can use Jekyll to host your project’s page, blog, or website from GitHub's servers for free.

The front matter is where Jekyll starts to get really cool. Any file that contains a YAML front matter block will be processed by Jekyll as a special file. The front matter must be the first thing in the file and must take the form of valid YAML set between triple-dashed lines.
