Folks, this is killer. For what this cobbler lacks in beauty it makes up ten-fold in taste, especially after a full day on the move. Not much mise en place when it comes to camp cooking, and I wouldnâ€™t want it any other way. Any summer fruit combination will do. I had strawberries and rhubarb on hand for this trip. I imagine peaches, plums, cherries, or blackberries will be fantastic as they come into season this summer.

<ul>
    <li>2 lbs strawberries, hulled and halved</li>
    <li>2 stalks rhubarb, sliced</li>
    <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
    <li>3 cups flour (I used pastry)</li>
</ul>
